Scrummer Kanban
===============

This module extends Scrummer with components needed for managing projects
with Kanban methodology. It creates backlog view for tasks that are not
yet ready to go to first stage of Kanban workflow, kanban view where tasks
can be dragged from one column to the other according to defined workflow.

Usage
=====
Enable Use Agile on projects and choose Kanban as Agile Method. Choose
appropriate workflow for your projects (There is a Simple Kanban Workflow
that you can use for quick start).

Go to Project > Boards > Boards and create your board, or modify existing
Default Kanban Board. Add your projects to board. After adding projects to
the board, you may see some Workflow states in Unmapped States list. Each
Board Column can map to multiple Workflow States.

Add projects to Kanban team and open Scrummer.
Based on Board configuration, some tasks will be shown in Backlog (Defined
in Backlog States page on Board), and some will appear in Initial Column.
Purpose of Backlog view is to enable user to write task and manipulate it
until it's ready to go to To do state.

In Kanban view, user can drag & drop tasks according to the projects
workflow.
