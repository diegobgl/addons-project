                with Kanban methodology. It creates backlog view for tasks that are not
                yet ready to go to first stage of Kanban workflow, kanban view where tasks
                can be dragged from one column to the other according to defined workflow.

                appropriate workflow for your projects (There is a Simple Kanban Workflow
                that you can use for quick start).
                <br/><br/>
                Go to Project > Boards > Boards and create your board, or modify existing
                Default Kanban Board. Add your projects to board. After adding projects to
                the board, you may see some Workflow states in Unmapped States list. Each
                Board Column can map to multiple Workflow States.
                <br/>
                Add projects to Kanban team and open Scrummer.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center mt24">
                Based on Board configuration, some tasks will be shown in Backlog (Defined
                in Backlog States page on Board), and some will appear in Initial Column.
                Purpose of Backlog view is to enable user to write task and manipulate it
                until it's ready to go to To do state.
